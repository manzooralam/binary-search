# binary-search:
Binary search, also known as half-interval search, logarithmic search, or binary chop

Binary search is a fast search algorithm with run-time complexity of Ο(log n). This search algorithm works on the principle of divide and conquer. And data collection should be in the sorted form.

Binary search looks for a particular item by comparing the middle most item of the collection. If a match occurs, then the index of item is returned. If the middle item is greater than the item, then the item is searched in the sub-array to the left of the middle item. Otherwise, the item is searched for in the sub-array to the right of the middle item. This process continues on the sub-array as well until the size of the subarray reduces to zero.

#### Middle index find as:
mid = low + (high - low) / 2

## Pseudocode:

```
Procedure binary_search
   A ← sorted array
   n ← size of array
   x ← value to be searched

   Set lowerBound = 1
   Set upperBound = n 

   while x not found
      if upperBound < lowerBound 
         EXIT: x does not exists.
   
      set midPoint = lowerBound + ( upperBound - lowerBound ) / 2
      
      if A[midPoint] < x
         set lowerBound = midPoint + 1
         
      if A[midPoint] > x
         set upperBound = midPoint - 1 

      if A[midPoint] = x 
         EXIT: x found at location midPoint
   end while
   
end procedure

```
## Implemented in java:

```
// Java implementation of recursive Binary Search 
class BinarySearch { 
	// Returns index of x if it is present in arr[l.. 
	// r], else return -1 
	int binarySearch(int arr[], int l, int r, int x) 
	{ 
		if (r >= l) { 
			int mid = l + (r - l) / 2; 

			// If the element is present at the 
			// middle itself 
			if (arr[mid] == x) 
				return mid; 

			// If element is smaller than mid, then 
			// it can only be present in left subarray 
			if (arr[mid] > x) 
				return binarySearch(arr, l, mid - 1, x); 

			// Else the element can only be present 
			// in right subarray 
			return binarySearch(arr, mid + 1, r, x); 
		} 

		// We reach here when element is not present 
		// in array 
		return -1; 
	} 

	// Driver method to test above 
	public static void main(String args[]) 
	{ 
		BinarySearch ob = new BinarySearch(); 
		int arr[] = { 2, 3, 4, 10, 40 }; 
		int n = arr.length; 
		int x = 10; 
		int result = ob.binarySearch(arr, 0, n - 1, x); 
		if (result == -1) 
			System.out.println("Element not present"); 
		else
			System.out.println("Element found at index " + result); 
	} 
}
